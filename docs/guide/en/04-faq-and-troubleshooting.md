## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Will creating a clone affect my original app's data?
**No. Never.**

ATBClone enforces strict physical and container-level isolation:
* The primary application continues reading and writing to its original standard paths (such as `~/Library/Application Support/` or `~/Library/Containers/<OriginalBundleID>`).
* The clone operates exclusively inside its own isolated folder (e.g., `~/ATBClone/Data/<CloneName>/`).
* Both instances run concurrently without database locking, preference collisions, or cache pollution.

---

### 2. Where is cloned data stored, and how do I back it up?
By default, all user data (databases, local chat archives, cache, cookies, and preferences) is stored in:
`~/ATBClone/Data/<CloneName>/`

```text
~/ATBClone/
├── config.yaml           # User configuration & preferences
├── clones.yaml           # Registry of all created clones
├── recipes/              # User custom recipe directory
└── Data/
    ├── WeChat2/          # WeChat clone data sandbox
    │   ├── Home/         # Isolated $HOME directory
    │   └── Tmp/          # Isolated $TMPDIR directory
    └── Telegram-Work/    # Telegram clone data sandbox
```

#### How to Back Up or Migrate:
* **To Back Up**: Copy or compress the `~/ATBClone/Data/<CloneName>` folder to an external backup drive or cloud storage.
* **To Migrate to a New Mac**: Copy your entire `~/ATBClone/` directory to the new Mac, install ATBClone, and clone your apps using the same names. Your accounts and chat histories will be immediately recognized!

---

### 3. Will my account get banned for multi-instancing?
**ATBClone operates strictly at the macOS operating system environment level.**
* **No Reverse-Engineering / Code Injection**: ATBClone does **not** use runtime code hooking (such as Frida, Cycript, or dynamic dylib injection) and does **not** tamper with in-memory application logic or network packets.
* **Pure Environment Deception**: The application runs completely unmodified; it is simply presented with an isolated `$HOME` directory and custom bundle identifier.
* **Anti-Fingerprint Proxy Isolation**: By configuring a dedicated HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy per clone, each instance can connect via a distinct IP address, preventing IP-level association across multiple accounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While ATBClone provides safe, clean OS-level sandbox isolation, you must still comply with the terms of service of individual platforms (e.g., avoiding abusive mass messaging or unauthorized bot automation).

---

### 4. Do I need Administrator (Root / Sudo) privileges?
* **When installing to `~/ATBClone/Apps` (Default & Recommended)**: **Zero administrator privileges or passwords required.** Everything runs in standard user space.
* **When installing to system `/Applications`**: macOS will prompt you once via standard native system dialog for authorization to write to the global application folder.

---

### 5. What should I do if macOS says "App is damaged and can't be opened"?
This is caused by macOS Gatekeeper flagging modified application bundles with the quarantine extended attribute (`com.apple.quarantine`).

#### Solution:
Open Terminal and run the quarantine removal command:
```bash
xattr -cr "/path/to/YourClonedApp.app"
```
Or simply select the clone inside ATBClone and click **"Update"** to allow ATBClone to automatically strip quarantine attributes and refresh the ad-hoc signature.

---

### 6. How do I change the clone's icon?
1. Open Finder and locate your clone in `~/ATBClone/Apps`.
2. Select the app and press `Cmd + I` (Get Info).
3. Drag any `.icns` or `.png` image file onto the small application icon at the top-left of the Info inspector window.

---

### 7. How do communication clones (e.g., WeChat, QQ) display Menu Bar icons and receive background messages?

Instant messaging apps like WeChat and QQ support residing in the macOS top Menu Bar (Status Bar) and receiving incoming messages in the background.

#### 1. Enabling the Menu Bar Status Icon:
* After launching and logging into the cloned WeChat, press `Cmd + ,` or navigate to **WeChat -> Settings / Preferences**.
* In the **General** settings tab, verify and enable **"Show WeChat in Menu Bar"** (在菜单栏显示微信图标).
* The ATBClone engine automatically seeds your primary app's initial preferences on first launch; if this option was enabled in your main app, the clone will inherit it immediately.

#### 2. Background Message Reception & Notifications:
* **Background Long-Polling Connection**: Because clones use ad-hoc re-signing, Apple's push notification service (APNs) cannot directly route to clones. Instead, WeChat maintains its own active TCP/WebSocket connection (`LongLink`) in the background to receive private and group messages in real time.
* **Keep Running in the Background**: When finished chatting, simply click the red close button (`x`) on the main window. The clone will remain active in the Menu Bar and background; **do not press `Cmd + Q` to terminate it**.
* **Alerts & Badges**: When a new message arrives, the Menu Bar icon displays an unread indicator/red dot, the Dock icon badge updates, and alert sounds play.
* **Notification Permissions**: When prompted with "Allow notifications for WeChat", click "Allow". You can also verify notification permissions in macOS **System Settings -> Notifications**.

> [!TIP]
> **Under the Hood**: Communication apps like WeChat and Telegram rely on ATBClone's **`dylib` native in-process injection mode** (keep `auto` or select `dylib` when cloning). This avoids `execv` process replacement, which alters process version (`PIDVersion`) and breaks macOS Notification Center (`usernoted`) and Menu Bar status item (`MenuBarAgent`) registration. If `launcher` mode is accidentally selected, notifications and menu bar status icons may be silently suppressed by macOS.

## ChatGPT clone does not respond after creation

Check the installed ATBClone version and any matching YAML override in `~/ATBClone/recipes/`. In one local investigation, a clone created with ATBClone 1.3.0 and an old `com.openai.codex.yaml` did not respond. Rebuilding with the 1.4.0 source engine and built-in recipe restored the independent sign-in screen. Updating the application alone does not merge or replace user recipes.

If an update reports `Operation not permitted`, check whether the clone bundle still exists and back up its data before addressing the copy failure. A successful request to open the bundle does not prove startup succeeded; verify the actual window and backend services.

The default Codex clone configuration directory is `~/ATBClone/Data/<CloneName>/Codex`, set through `CODEX_HOME`. For example, configure `ChatGPT2` in `~/ATBClone/Data/ChatGPT2/Codex/config.toml`, then fully quit and restart the clone.

See the [investigation, recovery steps, and verification limits (Chinese)](../../troubleshooting/chatgpt-clone-startup.md). API requests after authentication were not tested in this investigation.

## 🩺 System Diagnostics (Doctor Tab)

If you encounter unexpected behavior during cloning or signing, run our built-in system diagnostic check:

```

1. Click **"Doctor"** (`🩺`) in the ATBClone sidebar navigation.
2. The Doctor probe automatically validates:
   * **Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select -p`)**: Ensures Apple developer tools are installed for code signing.
   * **Codesign & PlistBuddy**: Verifies system binary utilities.
   * **Storage Directory Access**: Checks read/write permissions for `~/ATBClone/Apps` and `~/ATBClone/Data`.
3. If any item shows an error or warning, follow the on-screen resolution tips (e.g., running `xcode-select --install`).
